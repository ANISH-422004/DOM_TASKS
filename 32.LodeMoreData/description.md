In this task, we will build a React-based product listing application that fetches data from an external API (dummyjson.com/products). The application will display products in fixed-size cards, each showing the product's title and price, arranged in a grid layout with consistent spacing. Initially, 10 products will be loaded, and clicking the "Load More Data" button will fetch and append 10 more products to the list, continuing until a total of 100 products are displayed. The product list will be scrollable, allowing users to view all products. Once 100 products are fetched, the button will change its text to "No More Products to Display," its color will turn gray, and further clicks will be disabled using pointer-events: none. Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, with green-bordered product cards, white text, and rounded corners. This task will reinforce key React concepts such as state management with useState, side effects using useEffect for data fetching, dynamic rendering, conditional styling, and user interaction handling.
