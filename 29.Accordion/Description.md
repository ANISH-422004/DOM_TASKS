The Accordion component is a React-based interactive list that supports both single and multi-selection modes. In single selection mode, only one item's answer is displayed at a time, and clicking on an item toggles its visibility. In multi-selection mode, multiple items can be expanded simultaneously, with answers being toggled on click.

Key features include:

1.State management using useState for tracking selections:
        a.selected: Stores the ID of the currently selected item in single selection mode.
        b.enableMultiselection: Toggles between single and multi-selection modes.
        c.multiselected: Holds the IDs of selected items in multi-selection mode.
2.A toggle button that switches between selection modes.
3.Dynamic rendering of answers based on the selected state, providing an intuitive and responsive user experience.
