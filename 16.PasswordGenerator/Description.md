This task uses the concepts of useRef and useEffect. The task is simple. We will create a React app that helps us generate passwords with varying lengths. For example, you can generate a password with a length ranging from 8 to 20 characters, which might include numbers or special characters depending on the user's choice. Additionally, we will add functionality to include a "Copy" button, which allows the user to copy the generated password.
